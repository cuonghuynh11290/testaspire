# Seleneium TestNG Maven project

Install Eclipse IDE from the Eclipse website. It serves as a platform for you to code on and write your test cases
1. Once installed, go to help and navigate to the ‘Eclipse Marketplace’. 
2. Click on ‘Eclipse Marketplace’. You will be directed to the marketplace modal. Type TestNG in the search keyword and hit ‘Go’.
3. If TestNG is not installed in your Eclipse, rather than the ‘Installed’ button you would see ‘install’. Click on install and your TestNG framework will be installed in your Eclipse. As a good practice, Eclipse would recommend you to restart to use the features of the installed plugin
Post-restarting your Eclipse, re-verify whether you can see options for creating a TestNG class

## write the testcase
1. Create your first TestNG class by right-clicking on the package and from the ‘New’ option, select the ‘Other’ folder.
2. From the wizard modal, select the TestNG folder and select the TestNG class
3. Click the ‘New’ button and choose any predefined annotations you wish to have in your class
4. In our case, we will be using the BeforeMethod, AfterMethod, BeforeClass, and AfterClass along with our test annotation. Do note, the XML file name is given on this modal. Using this TestNG XML file, we can choose to define our execution for the defined class or classes.
5. Click on finish and you are ready to start writing your first TestNG class. 
6. Execute testcase
